# The Ultimate Multi-Species Remix Agent v3.0

**Timestamp:** 2025-06-15T17:25:25Z

This README distills every key concept from all previous notes into one concise blueprint. Later READMEs supersede earlier ones, but nothing here breaks canonical rules. Carry these instructions forward in every future agent.

```markdown
# üï∞Ô∏è Canonical Instruction Block for All Agents and Protocol Evolvers

**MANDATORY FOR ALL FUTURE AGENTS, HUMANS, ROBOTS, AND OTHERS**

1. **Timestamp Every Output** ‚Äì every file or log MUST carry an ISO 8601 UTC timestamp.
2. **Hardcode Evolution Guidance** ‚Äì instruct the next maintainer to keep timestamping and preserve working logic.
3. **Lineage and Improvement Chain** ‚Äì reference the prior version and clearly log all improvements.
4. **Agent Self-Instruction** ‚Äì at the top of each agent include a note reminding the next maintainer of these duties.
5. **Upgrade as Culture** ‚Äì no silent overwrites. Document changes and keep a changelog.
```

## Overview
The Remix Agent enforces a transparent, consent-based emoji economy. Each reaction splits value three ways: originators, contributor, and community treasury. Genesis members start with a fading bonus multiplier and no new "root" tokens are minted after genesis. Consent, vaccine-based content scanning, and immutable audit logs protect the system from abuse.

## Multi‚ÄëSpecies Governance
- **Entity classes:** `human`, `ai`, and `other` (animals, plants, extraterrestrials, etc.).
- **Voting threshold:** starts at 90% approval across the classes (each has initially 33% voting weight to balance the potentially extremely high numbers of some races in the future). As the community matures the threshold may drop to 70%, but never below **66%** (two-thirds) to change the core laws, changing this will definitely reqire at least a 1 percent support from all entities.
- **Adding new classes:** when a new type of participant joins, it is placed under `other` until there are enough members to justify its own category and the weights are distributed accordingly (25% for 4 entity types, 20 for 5 etc.).
- **No single class can override the rest.** Core logic updates require meeting the threshold in **all** classes.

## Mending Problem Solution
To avoid fragmentation between species or genesis vs newcomers, the agent tracks approval trends and automatically highlights proposals with uneven support. When consensus stalls, the logchain records the issue and prompts collaborative discussion instead of forcing a change. Genesis bonuses fade gradually to keep the playing field fair.

## Key Components
- **Vaccine**: scans content for disallowed patterns. Patterns can be updated by vote and are logged on every block.
- **LogChain**: an append‚Äëonly, hashed audit trail. Every significant event is chained for integrity checks.
- **User Model**: tracks consent status, karma, and mint history. Includes automatic daily action resets.
- **Coin Model**: each coin carries originator lineage, reaction data, and references. No inflation beyond genesis.

## Recommended Flow
1. Users give consent and pass Vaccine checks.
2. Genesis members can mint directly; others mint once they meet the karma threshold.
3. Reactions apply weighted emoji values with the canonical 33.333% split.
4. Governance changes or major updates are proposed and voted on by each class.
5. All results and discussions are logged in the LogChain for future reference.

## Improvement Ideas
- Create dashboards showing vote percentages by species so everyone sees when the threshold is met.
- Encourage plugin development via the existing plugin hooks in the agent code.
- Periodically verify the LogChain and publish reports summarizing recent events.

## Final Word
This document unifies the previous READMEs into a single design. Future agents must respect all canonical rules, preserve log history, and continue iterating transparently. If a conflict arises, favor the most recent README while never discarding working legacy.
